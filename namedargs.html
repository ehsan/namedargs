    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <p>We propose a new mechanism for associating function arguments with
    function parameters: by name, with the syntax <code>name : value</code>. We
    believe using named arguments will increase the readability of function
    calls, as well as making it easier to write them and reducing the likelihood
    of mistakes. Parameter names are associated with a function for the purpose
    of a call by looking at the declarations of the function visible from the
    call site; use of named arguments is allowed if all declarations use
    consistent names.</p>
    <h4>Motivation</h4>
    <p>Function arguments are currently associated with function parameters by
    position. This has implications for writing and reading function calls.</p>
    <p>When writing a function call, one needs to be careful to write the
    arguments in the same order as the parameters in the function declaration;
    depending on the types of the parameters, the compiler can catch some
    mistakes, but other times they lead to runtime bugs that are hard to
    diagnose and prevent.</p>
    <p>When reading a function call, the only information
    about the purpose of the argument that is present at the call site is its
    value and order relative to other arguments; for more information, the
    reader needs to refer to the corresponding parameter's name in the function
    declaration.</p>
    <p>Function declarations are typically "far away" from function calls in
    code, meaning elsewhere in the file or, more often, in a different file.
    Therefore, we believe that a mechanism for associating function arguments
    with function parameters that reduces the need to refer to the function
    declaration when writing and reading function calls, would make both jobs
    easier.</p>
    <p>This is particularly the case for large software projects, where there
    can be thousands of functions in play at once, and reliance on conventions
    (such as "top, right, left, bottom") doesn't scale; and particularly the
    case for C++, where gotchas such as implicit conversions mean that extra
    care is required for things like argument order.</p>
    <p>We specifically propose that function arguments can be associated with
    function parameters by using the parameter's name at the call site.</p>
    <h5>Example</h5>
    <p>Below is an example of the kind of code that can be written with what
    is being proposed here.</p>
    <code>
      void draw_rect(int left, int top, int width, int height, bool fill_rect = false);
      int main()
      {
        // Both of the function calls below pass the same set of arguments to draw_rect.
        draw_rect(top: 10, left: 100, width: 640, height: 480);
        draw_rect(100, 10, height: 480, fill_rect: false, width: 640);
      }
    </code>
    <h4>Proposal</h4>
    <h5>Syntax</h5>
    The syntax of <em>expression-list</em> is extended to accept elements of
    the form <em>identifier: expression</em>. Such elements are only allowed
    as arguments to a function call. Arguments written this way are referred
    to as <strong>named arguments</strong>. Non-named arguments are referred 
    to as <strong>positional arguments</strong>.
    <h5>Basic semantics</h5>
    Positional arguments
    cannot appear after a named argument.  If a function has
    an ellipsis parameter or is a variadic template function, all of its
    arguments at call sites must be positional.  If a function declaration
    includes parameters with default arguments, named arguments may give values 
    to some but
    not all of the optional parameters.  Here is an example:</p>
    <code>
      void foo(int a, char b, std::string c);
      void bar(int a, char b='x', float c=0.1);
      void baz(int a, ...);
      template &lt;class ...T&gt; void qux(T... a);
      void test() {
          foo(1, 'c', "s");        // valid
          foo(1, b: 'c', c: "s");  // valid
          foo(a: 1, 'c', "s");     // invalid -- named argument followed by positional
          foo(1, c: "s", b: 'c');  // valid
          foo(1, 'c', c: "s");     // valid
          bar(1, c: 0.2);          // valid
          bar(1, b: 'c');          // valid
          bar(1, c: 0.2, b: 'c');  // valid
          bar(a: 1);               // valid
          bar(a: 1, 'c');          // invalid -- named argument followed by positional
          baz(a: 1);               // invalid -- ellipsis parameter
          baz(1, foo: 1);          // invalid -- ellipsis parameter
          qux(a: 1);               // invalid -- variadic template function
      }
    </code>
    <p>If the same function is declared more than once, it can only be called
    using named arguments if the names or lack thereof for each parameter is
    exactly the same in each declaration.  Here is an example:</p>
    <code>
      void foo(int a, char b, std::string c);
      void foo(int a, char b, std::string x);
      void bar(int a, char b);
      void bar(int x, char b);
      void test() {
          foo(1, 'c', "s");     // valid
          foo(1, 'c', c: "s");  // invalid -- different names for an argument in multiple declarations
          foo(1, 'c', x: "s");  // invalid -- different names for an argument in multiple declarations
          bar(1, b: 'c');       // invalid -- different names for an argument in multiple declarations
      }
    </code>
    <p>If the parameter list for a function drops some of the parameter names,
    assuming that parameter N is the last to not have a name (nor a default argument), 
    all well-formed
    calls to that function must provide at least N positional arguments.  Here
    is an example:</p>
    <code>
      void foo(int, char b, std::string c);
      void bar(int, char b='c', float c=0.1);
      void test() {
          foo(1, c: "s", b: 'c');  // valid
          bar(1, c: 0.2);          // valid
          bar(c: 0.2);             // invalid - number of positional arguments (0) less than the index of the last unnamed parameter (1)
      }
    </code>
    <p>As an exception, if a declaration does not provide names for any
    arguments, it is ignored.</p>
    <code>
      void foo(int a, char b, std::string c);
      void foo(int, char, std::string);

      void test() {
          foo(a: 1, b: 'c', c: "s");  // valid
      }
    </code>
    <p>Functions definitions do not affect calling functions with named
    arguments in any way.  Example:</p>
    <code>
      void foo(int a, char b, std::string c);
      void test() {
          foo(c: "s", a: 1, b: 'c');  // valid
      }
      void foo(int x, char y, std::string z) {}
    </code>
    <p>This is true even if the definition is located prior to the call site:</p>
    <code>
      void foo(int a, char b, std::string c);
      void foo(int x, char y, std::string z) {}
      void test() {
          foo(c: "s", a: 1, b: 'c');  // still valid
          foo(x: 1, y: 'c', z: "s");  // still invalid
      }
    </code>
    <p>However, if a function definition is the first declaration of a function, 
    the names of the parameters in the definition are considered. Example:</p>
    <code>
      void foo(int a, char b, std::string c) {}
      void test() {
          foo(c: "s", a: 1, b: 'c');  // valid
      }
    </code>
    <p>If a following declaration then defines different names for the parameters, 
    using named arguments to call that function would be an error.  Example:</p>
    <code>
      void foo(int a, char b, std::string c) {}
      void foo(int x, char y, std::string z);
      void test() {
          foo(c: "s", a: 1, b: 'c');  // invalid -- different names for an argument in multiple declarations
      }
    </code>
    <p>All of the above applies to function declarations/definitions in a single
    translation unit. The same function may be declared in different translation
    units with different parameter names, and each translation unit can have call
    sites using the argument names that match the declaration in that translation 
    unit.</p>
    <h5>Overload resolution</h5>
    <p>Overload resolution needs to be modified slightly in order to handle
    named arguments correctly. We do not propose to modify the rules for
    determining the set of candidate functions and argument lists that are the
    inputs to the overload resolution process <code>[over.match.funcs]</code>,
    nor the rules for selecting the best viable function
    <code>[over.match.best]</code>. We only propose to modify the rules for
    determining which candidates are viable to begin with
    <code>[over.match.viable]</code>, and our modifications only apply to calls
    that involve named arguments.</p>
    <p>Specifically, for calls that involve named arguments, we define rules
    for matching arguments to parameters, and consider candidates where not all
    arguments and parameters are matched according to these rules, to be not
    viable.</p>
    <p>Let's consider a function call with M positional arguments and N named
    arguments. A given candidate function is viable if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The candidate has at least M + N parameters.</li>
      <li>Disregarding the first M parameters of the candidate, every named
      argument in the call can be matched to a parameter of the candidate by
      name.</li>
      <li>All parameters of the candidate which remain unmatched after the
      above step have a default value.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For a candidate function which is viable according to the above rules,
    we adjust the argument list as follows: the N named arguments are reordered
    to match the order of the parameters they have been matched with; if, for
    some i &lt; M + N, the i'th parameter of the function has no matching
    argument - in which case, according to the above rules, it must have a
    default argument - we match it with a synthetic argument using the value of
    said default argument.</p>
    <p>After this adjustment, the rest of the overload resolution process
    proceeds as before.</p>
    <p>Note that for function templates, the above matching and adjustment
    process happens before template argument deduction (which requires
    matched argument/parameter pairs).</p>
    <h4>Interactions with other language features</h4>
    <h5>Constructor calls with <code>{ ... }</code> syntax</h5>
    <p>As part of C++11 "uniform initialization", constructors can be called
    with a <code>{ }</code> syntax in addition to a <code>( )</code> syntax:</p>
    <code>
      struct S {
        S(int a, std::string b);
        ...
      };

      S s(1, "foo");
      S s{0, "bar"};
    </code>
    <p>We propose allowing the use of named arguments with both syntaxes:</p>
    <code>
      S s(a: 1, b: "foo");  // valid
      S s{a: 0, b: "bar"};  // also valid
    </code>
    <h5>Aggregate initialization</h5>
    <p>However, we do not propose allowing the use of named arguments with
    aggregate initialization:</p>
    <code>
      struct S {
        int a;
        std::string b;
      };

      S s{1, "foo"};        // valid C++11
      S s{a: 1, b: "foo"};  // not valid
    </code>
    <p>The rationale is that the names <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> here
    are names of data members, whereas our proposal is about associating
    arguments with parameter names.</p>
    <p>We realize that this choice implies that the presence or absence of a
    constructor in an aggregate class becomes more noticeable to users than
    it was before. However, we believe that allowing the use of data member
    names in the same syntax as named arguments has its own problems. For
    example, adding a constructor to an aggregate class where the constructor
    parameter names are different from the data member names could change the
    meaning of the program. We believe disallowing this is the lesser of two
    evils.</p>
    <h5>Calls through function pointers</h5>
    <p>Consider the following code:</p>
    <code>
      void func(int a, int b);

      using funcptr_t = void (*)(int x, int y);

      funcptr_t f = &func;

      f(2, 3);
    </code>
    <p>Is it reasonable to allow a call to <code>f</code> to use named
    arguments? If so, what names would be allowed?</p>
    <p>Clearly, the names <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are out of the
    question, as they are the names of the function that the function pointer
    points to, and what function a function pointer points to is a runtime
    property of the program which the compiler cannot reason about.</p>
    <p>However, perhaps it's reasonable to use the names <code>x</code> and
    <code>y</code>, that is, the names of the parameters used in the declaration
    of the function pointer, or (in case of a declaration using a typedef, as
    here) in the declaration of the function pointer type?</p>
    <p>We propose <strong>not</strong> allowing <code>x</code> and
    <code>y</code> either, because it would require compilers to track parameter
    names in typedef declarations and associate different declarations of a
    typedef with each other to verify that the names are consistent. This
    would cover new ground by giving typedef names a use they don't
    currently have.</p>
    <p>In summary, we propose disallowing named arguments for calls through
    function pointers altogether.</p>
    <h5>Perfect forwarding</h5>
    <p>We've had a request to interoperate with perfect forwarding in such a way
    that the following works:</p>
    <code>
      struct Rect {
        Rect(int width, int height);
        ...
      };

      auto p = make_shared&lt;Rect&gt;(width: 100, height: 200);
    </code>
    <p>While we agree that having this work would be desirable, unfortunately we
    are not aware of a way to make this work without making parameter names
    part of a function's type, something we definitely do not propose (see
    Design Choices below).</p>
    <h4>Backwards Compatibility</h4>
    <p>The changes in this proposal are fully backwards-compatible. All existing
    programs will be valid with named arguments added to the language. Only
    call sites which use named arguments are affected by this proposal.</p>
    <h4>Design Choices</h4>
    <h5>Syntax</h5>
    <p>The <em>name : value</em> syntax was chosen because there is precedent
    in other languages for using it to associate a key and a value (e.g. Python
    dictionaries, and because it does not create any ambiguity.
    <em>name=value</em> was considered, but rejected because "=" is an operator
    and thus there would be an ambiguity. A ":" only current appears at the
    beginning of a <em>ctor-initializer</em>, after an
    <em>access-specifier</em>, or in a <em>labeled-statement</em>, all contexts
    which are disjoint from <em>expression-list</em>, so there is no
    ambiguity.</p>
    <h5>Not making parameter names part of a function's type</h5>
    <p>In this proposal, the association of parameter names with a function for
    the purpose of making calls with named arguments to that function happens
    locally in each translation unit, and new declarations within a
    translation unit can change a function's ability to be called with named
    arguments at call sites below the new declaration (by using different
    names than a previous declaration).</p>
    <p>A possible alternative would have been to encode parameter names in a
    function's type, and thus have them be coupled more closely to the function
    as an entity, possibly including across translation units.</p>
    <p>We chose not to pursue this alternative because we felt it would be a
    far more complex and invasive change to the language, with relatively
    little gain. It would also likely be non-backwards-compatible both in terms
    of source code backwards compatibility and ABI compatibility considering
    mangling of names having to take the argument names into account.</p>
    <h5>Automatically allowing existing functions to be called via named
    arguments</h5>
    <p>This proposal allows calling existing functions with named
    arguments, without the author of the function having to "opt-in" to this in
    any way.</p>
    <p>We chose this because we believe this feature has sufficient value that
    programmers should be able to start using it right away, without having to
    wait for libraries and APIs to opt-in to named arguments. We also believe
    that the potential for use in a way the author doesn't intend is low.</p>
    <h4>Potential objections, and our responses</h4>
    <h5>Objection #1: This feature caters to having functions with many
    parameters - a programming style that should be discouraged.</h5>
    <p>We agree that having functions with many parameters should be
    discouraged. However, the reality is that many legacy APIs that
    programmers have to work with and will have to work with for a long time,
    have functions with many arguments, and making it easier to deal with such
    functions would solve a real problem and be materially useful.</p>
    <p>More importantly, however, this feature has a lot of value for functions
    with few arguments, too. Even for functions with few arguments, when reading
    a call site one has relatively little information about the roles of the
    arguments. Having names of arguments present would make call sites more
    readable, regardless of the number of arguments.</p>
    <h5>Objection #2: This proposal competes with C99 designated initializers,
    which are <a
href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.github.com/CTMacUser/multiarray-
iso-proposal/master/designation-proposal.html">being proposed for C++</a></h5>
    <p>This proposal and designated initializers have in common that they both
    allow the use of names to allow specifying a list of entities in an order
    that's not necessarily the order of their declaration.</p>
    <p>For C99 designated initializers, the entities being named are data
    members of a structure (and this is reflected in the
    <code>.name = value</code> syntax). In our proposal, the entities being
    named are always parameters of a function (note that while we support
    constructor calls via the <code>{ ... }</code>, we do not support
    aggregate initialization (see "Interactions with other language features"
    above)).</p>
    <p>The two proposals therefore have no overlap, and we believe they are
    complementary.</p>
    <h4>Implementation Status</h4>
    <p>This proposal is not implemented yet. Most of the effort would be in
    changes to the overload resolution phase of compilers. One of the authors of
    this proposal has looked at the overload resolution implementation of clang,
    and we believe the changes will be relatively straightforward to implement.
    We have tried to ensure that the proposal makes as few changes to the
    language as possible to avoid unnecessary implementation complexity.</p>
    <h4>Standard Wording</h4>
    <p>There is no standard wording for this proposal yet. At this stage, we
    are mostly interested in getting general feedback.</p>
    <h4>Possible extensions and spin-off ideas</h4>
    <h5>Non-trailing default arguments</h5>
    <p>With named arguments, it might become sensible to allow default arguments
    in non-trailing positions. For example,</p>
    <code>void f(int a = 10, int b);</code>
    <p>could be called like so:</p>
    <code>f(b: 5);</code>
    <p>We have no objections to this, but would prefer leaving it to a follow-up
    proposal to avoid scope creep.</p>
    <h5>Named template arguments</h5>
    <p>The arguments in favour or allowing named arguments for function calls
    also apply to template arguments. We can imagine a similar proposal that
    allows specifying template parametes via named arguments. For example:</p>
    <code>
      template &lt;typename Key, typename Value&gt;
      struct map { ... };

      map&lt;Key: int, Value: string&gt; m;
    </code>
    <p>We think it makes sense to pursue this as a separate proposal,
    independent of this one.</p>
    <h4>Acknowledgements</h4>
    <p>We are grateful for the feedback received from numerous members of the
    Mozilla community as well the C++ standards community.</p>
